# Applications Overview

The monorepo ships with two primary user-facing applications plus this documentation site.

| Application | Audience | Purpose | Primary Docs |
|-------------|----------|---------|--------------|
| `web` | Students & public visitors | Public-facing marketing and transactional site | [Web Application](/docs/applications/web-app) |
| `admin` | IT managers & content editors | Control center for content, commerce, and membership data | [Admin Application](/docs/applications/admin-app) |

<Callout type="info" title="Tip for new maintainers">
Skim this page first, then follow the persona-specific journeys below to get hands-on with each app.
</Callout>

## Choose Your Journey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Operate the public site">
    Learn page structure, routing, and feature toggles in the <Link href="/docs/applications/web-app">Web App</Link> section. Start with the feature-specific guides if you only need to manage events, e-commerce, or membership.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run content & commerce tooling">
    Head to the <Link href="/docs/applications/admin-app">Admin App</Link> guides to manage content, users, and shop data. Non-technical editors can follow the how-to articles, while developers can dive into the implementation notes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Need to update both?">
    Keep the <Link href="/docs/repository/project-structure">project structure overview</Link> handy. It explains where each app lives and how shared packages (UI, API, editor, payment) connect them.
  </Step>
