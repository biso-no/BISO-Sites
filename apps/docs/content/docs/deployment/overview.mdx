    ADMIN --> APPWRITE
    WEB --> VIPPS
```

## Build Commands

```bash

bun install

# Build all apps
bun run build

# Build specific app
bun run build --filter=web
bun run build --filter=admin
bun run build --filter=docs
```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)

1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Configure build settings per app
3. Set environment variables
4. Deploy

### Option 2: Docker

See [Docker Guide](/docs/repository/deployment/docker) for containerized deployment.

### Option 3: Self-Hosted

```bash
