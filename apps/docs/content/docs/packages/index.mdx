## Package Architecture

All packages are located in the `packages/` directory at the monorepo root:

```
packages/
├── api/           # Appwrite client wrapper
├── payment/       # Vipps integration
├── ui/            # Shared components
├── editor/        # Page builder
├── eslint-config/ # ESLint configurations
└── typescript-config/ # TypeScript configurations
```

## Using Packages

Packages are consumed by apps using workspace dependencies:

```json title="apps/web/package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@repo/api": "workspace:*",
    "@repo/payment": "workspace:*",
    "@repo/ui": "workspace:*"
  }
}
```

## Development

Each package has its own `package.json` and TypeScript configuration. Changes to packages are automatically detected by Turbo's caching system.

To work on a package:

1. Navigate to the package directory
2. Make your changes
3. Build the package if needed: `bun run build`
4. Test in consuming apps
