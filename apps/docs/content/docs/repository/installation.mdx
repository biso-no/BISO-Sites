# Installation Guide

This guide covers everything you need to install and configure the BISO Sites monorepo for development, from system prerequisites to full Appwrite integration.

<Callout type="info" title="Already set up?">
  If you just want to get running quickly, see the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart).
</Callout>

## Prerequisites

### Required Software

Before installing BISO SItes, ensure you have these tools installed:

| Tool | Version | Purpose | Install Link |
|------|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Node.js** | >= 18.0 | JavaScript runtime | [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) |
| **Bun** | >= 1.3.1 | Package manager & runtime | [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/docs/installation) |
| **Git** | Latest | Version control | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |

### Optional Tools

These are optional but recommended for the full development experience:

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Docker** | For running Appwrite locally |
| **VS Code** | Recommended IDE with great TypeScript support |
| **Appwrite Cloud Account** | Alternative to self-hosting Appwrite |

### Verify Installation

Check your installations:

```bash
# Check Node.js
node --version  # Should be >= 18.0

# Check Bun
bun --version   # Should be >= 1.3

# Check Git
git --version   # Any modern version
```

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the Repository">
    Get the code from your repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/biso-no/biso-sites.git
    cd biso-sites
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    Use Bun to install all workspace dependencies:
    
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
    
    This installs dependencies for:
    - All 3 applications (web, admin, docs)
    - All 5 packages (api, ui, editor, payment, configs)
    - Root workspace tools
    
    **What's happening?**
    - Bun reads `package.json` in the root
    - Identifies all workspaces in `apps/*` and `packages/*`
    - Installs dependencies for each workspace
    - Creates a single `node_modules` at the root
    - Generates `bun.lock` lockfile
    
    <Callout type="success" title="Fast Installation">
      Bun is significantly faster than npm/yarn. A full install typically takes 10-30 seconds.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify Installation">
    Ensure everything installed correctly:
    
    ```bash
    # Check workspace structure
    bun run --help
    
    # Verify TypeScript setup
    bun run check-types
    
    # Run linters
    bun run lint
    ```
    
    All commands should complete without errors.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Environment Setup

Each application requires environment variables for full functionality.

### Web Application Environment

Create `apps/web/.env.local`:

```bash
# Appwrite Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-endpoint.com/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id

# Optional: For server-side operations
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Payment Integration (Vipps)
NEXT_PUBLIC_VIPPS_CLIENT_ID=your-vipps-client-id
VIPPS_CLIENT_SECRET=your-vipps-secret
VIPPS_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY=your-subscription-key
VIPPS_TEST_MODE=true

# Optional: Analytics & Monitoring
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=your-google-analytics-id
```

### Admin Application Environment

Create `apps/admin/.env.local`:

```bash
# Appwrite Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://your-appwrite-endpoint.com/v1
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
APPWRITE_API_KEY=your-api-key

# AI Features (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key

# Admin-specific
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

### Docs Application Environment

The docs app typically doesn't need environment variables for local development.

<Callout type="warning" title="Never Commit Secrets">
  `.env.local` files are gitignored. Never commit secrets to the repository!
</Callout>

## Appwrite Setup

BISO SItes uses Appwrite as its backend. You have two options:

### Option 1: Appwrite Cloud (Recommended for Beginners)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Appwrite Account">
    Sign up at [cloud.appwrite.io](https://cloud.appwrite.io)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Project">
    - Click "Create Project"
    - Name it (e.g., "BISO SItes Development")
    - Copy the Project ID
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create an API Key">
    - Go to Settings → API Keys
    - Create new key with necessary permissions
    - Copy the API key (you won't see it again!)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Applications">
    - Add platform (Web) for your domains
    - For localhost: `http://localhost:3000`, `http://localhost:3001`
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Environment Variables">
    Update your `.env.local` files with:
    - Appwrite endpoint (from cloud)
    - Project ID
    - API key
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option 2: Self-Hosted Appwrite

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Docker">
    Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Appwrite">
    ```bash
    # Create directory for Appwrite
    mkdir appwrite
    cd appwrite
    
    # Download docker-compose.yml
    curl -o docker-compose.yml https://appwrite.io/install/compose
    
    # Start Appwrite
    docker compose up -d
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Appwrite Console">
    Open [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80) and complete setup wizard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Environment">
    Use `http://localhost:80/v1` as your `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info" title="Detailed Appwrite Setup">
  For complete Appwrite database schema and configuration, see [Appwrite Setup](/docs/deployment/appwrite-setup).
</Callout>

## Database Schema

Once Appwrite is set up, you need to create the database schema. This can be done via:

1. **Appwrite Console** - Manually create collections and attributes
2. **Appwrite CLI** - Import from `database.json` files
3. **Migration Scripts** - Run provided migration scripts

Example using Appwrite CLI:

```bash
# Install Appwrite CLI
npm install -g appwrite-cli

# Login to your Appwrite instance
appwrite login

# Deploy database schema (from apps/web or apps/admin)
cd apps/web
appwrite deploy collection
```

<Callout type="note">
  Database schema files are located in `apps/web/database.json` and `apps/admin/database.json`.
</Callout>

## Running the Applications

After installation and configuration:

### Start All Applications

```bash
# From root directory
bun run dev
```

This starts:
- Web app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Admin app on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- Docs on [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002)

### Start Individual Applications

```bash
# Web only
bun run dev --filter=web

# Admin only
bun run dev --filter=admin

# Docs only
bun run dev --filter=docs
```

### Build for Production

```bash
# Build all applications
bun run build

# Build specific application
bun run build --filter=web
```

## Development Tools Setup

### VS Code Extensions (Recommended)

Install these extensions for the best development experience:

```json
{
  "recommendations": [
    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint",
    "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
    "bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss",
    "ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-next",
    "unifiedjs.vscode-mdx"
  ]
}
```

### Git Hooks

Set up Git hooks for automatic linting and formatting:

```bash
# Install husky (if not already in package.json)
bun add -D husky

# Enable Git hooks
bunx husky install
```

## Verification Checklist

After installation, verify everything works:

- [ ] All dependencies installed without errors
- [ ] `bun run check-types` passes
- [ ] `bun run lint` passes
- [ ] `bun run dev` starts all applications
- [ ] Can access all three applications in browser
- [ ] Appwrite connection working (check browser console)
- [ ] Hot reload working (make a change and see it update)

## Troubleshooting

### Bun Installation Issues

If Bun fails to install:

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# On Windows (use WSL)
wsl --install
# Then install Bun in WSL
```

### Dependency Installation Failures

```bash
# Clear all node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules apps/*/node_modules packages/*/node_modules
rm bun.lock
bun install
```

### Port Conflicts

If ports 3000, 3001, or 3002 are already in use:

1. **Find and kill the process**:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

2. **Change the port** in `apps/*/package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev -p 3050"
  }
}
```

### Appwrite Connection Issues

1. **Verify environment variables** are correct
2. **Check Appwrite console** is accessible
3. **Verify platform is added** in Appwrite project settings
4. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
5. **Ensure CORS is configured** correctly in Appwrite

### TypeScript Errors

```bash
# Generate Next.js types
cd apps/web
bunx next build --typegen-only

# Check types across workspace
bun run check-types
```

### Module Resolution Issues

If imports aren't working:

1. Check `tsconfig.json` has correct paths
2. Restart TypeScript server in VS Code: `Cmd+Shift+P` → "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
3. Ensure package names in `package.json` match imports
