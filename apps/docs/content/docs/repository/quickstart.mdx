# 5-Minute Quickstart

This guide will get you up and running with the BISO Sites monorepo in about 5 minutes. We'll skip the theory and focus on getting the applications running on your machine.

<Callout type="info" title="Prerequisites">
  Before starting, make sure you have:
  - **Node.js 18+** installed
  - **Bun 1.3+** installed ([install here](https://bun.sh/docs/installation))
  - **Git** for version control
</Callout>

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd mon
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install dependencies">
    Bun makes this super fast:
    
    ```bash
    bun install
    ```
    
    This installs all dependencies for all apps and packages in the monorepo.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure environment variables (optional)">
    For basic development, you can skip this. The apps will work with mock data.
    
    For full functionality with Appwrite:
    
    ```bash
    # In apps/web/
    cp .env.example .env.local
    
    # In apps/admin/
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    
    <Callout type="note">
      See [Installation Guide](/docs/installation#environment-setup) for detailed environment configuration.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start all development servers">
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    
    This starts all three applications simultaneously:
    - **Web** (port 3000)
    - **Admin** (port 3001)
    - **Docs** (port 3002)
    
    <Callout type="warning" title="First build may take a moment">
      The first time you run this, Next.js needs to compile everything. Subsequent runs will be much faster thanks to caching.
    </Callout>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the applications">
    Once the servers are running, open these URLs:
    
    - **Web**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) - Public website
    - **Admin**: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) - Admin dashboard
    - **Docs**: [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) - Documentation
    
    <Callout type="success" title="You're running!">
      All three applications should now be running. Try navigating around and exploring the interfaces.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Running Individual Apps

Don't need all apps running? You can start them individually:

```bash
# Just the web app
bun run dev --filter=web

# Just the admin app
bun run dev --filter=admin

# Just the docs
bun run dev --filter=docs
```

## Making Your First Change

Let's verify hot reload works by making a small change:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open a component file">
    Open `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx` in your editor.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make a change">
    Change any text on the page and save the file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="See it update">
    Switch to your browser - the change should appear automatically without refreshing! This is Next.js Fast Refresh in action.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Commands

Here are the most common commands you'll use:

```bash
# Development
bun run dev                    # Start all apps
bun run dev --filter=web       # Start specific app

# Build
bun run build                  # Build all apps
bun run build --filter=web     # Build specific app

# Type checking
bun run check-types            # Check TypeScript across all packages

# Linting
bun run lint                   # Lint all packages
bun run format                 # Format code with Prettier
```

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use?

If you see errors about ports being taken:

```bash
# Find and kill processes on specific ports
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9  # Web
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9  # Admin
lsof -ti:3002 | xargs kill -9  # Docs
```

Or change the port in each app's `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev -p 3050"  // Use different port
  }
}
```

### Module not found errors?

Try reinstalling dependencies:

```bash
# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules apps/*/node_modules packages/*/node_modules
bun install
```

### Type errors?

Generate Next.js types:

```bash
bun run check-types
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have everything running:

1. **Understand the Architecture** - Read the [Architecture Overview](/docs/architecture/overview) to understand how everything fits together

2. **Explore the Packages** - Check out the [API Package](/docs/packages/api/overview) documentation to see how to use shared code

3. **Development Workflow** - Learn the [Development Workflow](/docs/guides/development-workflow) for day-to-day development

4. **Create Your First Feature** - Follow the [Creating Features](/docs/guides/creating-features) guide to build something new
