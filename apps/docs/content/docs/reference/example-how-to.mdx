# Example How-to: Publish a New Event

Use this template whenever you document a repeatable task. Swap the content with the real workflow, but keep the structure intact.

## Goal

Publish a new event that appears on the public web app with localized content and the correct registration link.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the [Admin App](/docs/applications/admin-app) with the `editor` or `admin` role.
- Event assets ready (cover image, description, ticket info).
- Optional: External registration link (Eventbrite, Hoopla, etc.).

<Callout type="info">
If you only need to update an existing event, jump to Step 3 and edit the existing record instead of creating a new one.
</Callout>

## Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the events module">
    Log into the [Admin App](/docs/applications/admin-app) and navigate to <code>/admin/events</code>. Click <strong>New Event</strong>.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill out event details">
    Enter the title, date, location, and description in Norwegian first. Use the language toggle to provide English translations.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attach image + registration">
    Upload a cover image (3:2 aspect ratio). Select <strong>Registration</strong> → choose <em>Internal</em> (Appwrite form) or <em>External</em> (paste the URL).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish & verify">
    Click <strong>Publish</strong>. Visit <code>/events</code> on the [Web App](/docs/applications/web-app/features/events) to confirm the new event appears in both locales.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Optional commands

Use the commands below if you need to preview the change locally before releasing it.

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    {
      label: 'Bun dev server',
      value: 'bun',
      content: (
        <pre>
<code>{`bun run dev --filter=admin
bun run dev --filter=web  # in another terminal`}</code>
        </pre>
      ),
    },
    {
      label: 'Docker compose',
      value: 'docker',
      content: (
        <pre>
<code>{`docker compose up -d admin web
docker compose logs -f admin`}</code>
        </pre>
      ),
    },
  ]}
/>

## Verification

1. The event appears on `/events` and `/no/events`.
2. Clicking the event shows the correct localized content.
3. Registration links or forms load as expected.

## Troubleshooting

- **Event missing?** Double-check that the event status is set to `published`.
- **Wrong order?** Update the event date/time or use the manual ordering field in the admin list view.
- **Broken image?** Confirm the file uploaded to the `events` storage bucket in Appwrite and that the URL is HTTPS.
